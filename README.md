# **PJS-Array-Methods**

# [This is my practices on Array Methods, click to see my Array Methods at work ðŸ˜‰](https://pjsalter.github.io/PJS-Array-Methods/)

#### I was tasked by Founders and Coders to create a frontend project that would initially interconnect with array functions I have made interactively.

## **Starting up the project:**

- ###### *Firstly setting up the **HTML, CSS and JavaScript** in **VS Code** in order for them to interlink with one another.*
- ###### *The **HTML** will need to include **input tags** that will accept strings.*
- ###### *I have used two different input tags that have a **type number**. This allows the user to type a number.*
- ###### *One input tag has a **type text** as it works with my function to of an array method to **take away repeats** for text and number.*
- ###### *All of the inputs will include a **label** for every function being including.*
- ###### *This includes three different **buttons** for the user to interact with.*
- ###### *This will output the results for the user displayed on the web page.*

## **The Functions being Used:**

- ###### *I have used the **reduce Higher Order Function method** that returns a singular value from a total of elements, such as numbers from the array it has been given.*
- ###### *The **filter Higher Order Function** is used, I named it divisible and it creates a new array filled with numbers that are divisible by two.*
- ###### *My third function that I created was taking an array of numbers or text and uses a method called **new set** within a **spread operator** to drop repeats within an array so that it will only return sigular values, but not doubles of them.*

## **The Use of Dom Manipulation**

- ###### *connecting the html attributes to the JavaScript page with **document.querySelector()**.*
- ###### *Creating the JavaScript to that once the user clicks the button then once of the functions of their choice will output a result on the main page.*
- ###### *The user is able to type out particular values, passing on an array as an argument from a function of choice.*
- ###### *Using **addEventListener** that has a clickable function in the javaScript code, this allows the user to click on the button for their answer, it also allows the particular function to run within that event listener.*
- ###### *The results will be displayed on the web page so that the user has their answer.*

## **How I can improve the User Experience?**

- ###### *I think that I can improve the user experience by modifying this page with making this fully responsive for all screen sizes.*
- ###### *Adding some styling to make this page more eye catching, adding a color scheme that suits the project.*
- ###### *styling on the page to have all text boxes and buttons for the functions at the centre and positions neatly on the page.*
- ###### *Font sizing needs changing so that its easier to read. making this more playful and fun for the user as if they are using the page like a fun fact game.*
- ###### *Additional instructions on how the user interacts with the page, so that they get a clear understanding.*
